## üìù Coding Standards

### C# Coding Conventions

Follow
Microsoft's [C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions):

```csharp
// ‚úÖ Good
public class EmailService : IEmailService
{
    private readonly ILogger<EmailService> _logger;
    
    public async Task<List<EmailMessage>> GetEmailsAsync(
        EmailAccount account, 
        string folderName, 
        int count = 50)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}

// ‚ùå Avoid
public class emailservice : IEmailService 
{
    private ILogger<EmailService> logger;
    
    public async Task<List<EmailMessage>> getEmails(EmailAccount account, string folderName, int count = 50)
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Use PascalCase** for public members, methods, and classes
- **Use camelCase** for private fields and local variables
- **Use underscore prefix** for private fields (`_fieldName`)
- **Use descriptive names** for variables and methods
- **Keep methods focused** - Single responsibility principle
- **Add XML documentation** for public APIs
- **Use async/await** for asynchronous operations
- **Handle exceptions** appropriately with try-catch blocks

### Blazor Component Guidelines

```razor
@* ‚úÖ Good component structure *@
@page "/example"
@using Seu.Mail.Services
@inject IEmailService EmailService

<PageTitle>Example - Seu Mail</PageTitle>

<div class="container">
    <h2>Example Component</h2>
    @if (isLoading)
    {
        <div class="spinner-border" role="status">
            <span class="visually-hidden">Loading...</span>
        </div>
    }
    else
    {
        <div class="content">
            <!-- Component content -->
        </div>
    }
</div>

@code {
    private bool isLoading = true;
    
    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        await LoadDataAsync();
    }
    
    private async Task LoadDataAsync()
    {
        try
        {
            // Load data
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Handle error
        }
        finally
        {
            isLoading = false;
        }
    }
}
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Write unit tests** for all new functionality
- **Use TUnit** testing framework (project standard)
- **Follow AAA pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Mock dependencies** using interfaces
- **Test both positive and negative scenarios**

### Test Example

```csharp
[Test]
public async Task GetEmailsAsync_WithValidAccount_ReturnsEmailList()
{
    // Arrange
    var mockContext = new Mock<EmailDbContext>();
    var emailService = new EmailService(mockContext.Object);
    var account = new EmailAccount { Id = 1, Email = "test@example.com" };

    // Act
    var result = await emailService.GetEmailsAsync(account, "INBOX", 10);

    // Assert
    Assert.NotNull(result);
    Assert.IsInstanceOf<List<EmailMessage>>(result);
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run tests with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test
dotnet test --filter "GetEmailsAsync_WithValidAccount_ReturnsEmailList"
```
